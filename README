SMS::MT
=======

Description
-----------

SMS::MT is a class that uses plugin modules to send mobile terminated SMS
messages via a simple and standard interface. All plugins are accessed through
the methods this class provides. This way, only one class and it's methods can
be used for different SMS MT services without the user having to go into the
details of how each of these services work.
I've included a HTML version of the POD docs in the docs subdirectory.
I've included the specs I used in the specs subdirectory.
